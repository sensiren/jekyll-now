<p style="text-align:center;"><em>I turn 25 at the end of April and every year I have people ask if I have a wishlist or something and while this is very sweet, I almost always forget to have one ready (I do have a deliverycode one but I don't love their system). </em>
<em>So for this year, I thought I would be outright extra and do my own gift guide.</em>
<em>This <strong>list is broken down into three sections: work, play and cosplay</strong> so you can choose what area you'd prefer to support.
</em>The email address for gift cards and PayPal is <strong>thesensiren@gmail.com</strong>

<strong>This category is ways you can support my teaching, content production, consultancy, blogging and writing and all the other ways I educate, create and advocate out in the world. If you like my core work this is the category for you.</strong> Happy to throw in a 30-minute skype coaching or consultancy session with items in this category if that's something useful to you.

<strong>Logo!
</strong>I have commissioned an amazing logo from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barbedwirelust/">Sam De Sa Gimenes of Barbed Wire Lust</a>. I'm obsessed with their work can can't wait to see the final project. Gift me this logo design by using <span style="text-decoration:underline;">PayPal to send $80USD to thesensiren@gmail.com</span> and you'll receive some of the first SenSiren branded goodies and a thank you card!

<strong>Printing!
</strong>With a new logo comes new business cards and other printed items, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">use PayPal to send $50 AUD to thesensiren@gmail.com</span> for new cards and flyers and I'll send you branded goodies and a thank you card!

<strong>Lightbox!
</strong>I want to take more beautiful product photos for my reviews and good lighting is key. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Use PayPal to send $30 AUD to thesensiren@gmail.com</span> so I can buy a light box and I'll send you branded goodies and a thank you card!
